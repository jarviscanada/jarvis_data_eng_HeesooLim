# Heesoo Lim . Jarvis Consulting

I graduated from Centennial College with a diploma in Software Engineering Technology, and I have recently started my career as a backend developer at Jarvis. During my time at Centennial College, I served as a Full-Stack Developer at Alpha Labs, where I developed the back-end of a web application by utilizing ASP.NET and SQL server to store user data and built the front-end by using ASP.NET. As a result, I was able to gain foundational skills in back-end and front-end development, in addition to learning the importance of time management, collaboration, and precise communication. I also acquired and refined complementary skills in software engineering throughout my academic and personal projects. I love to come up with exciting project ideas and make a plan for them so I can learn new technologies and develop my skills. I especially enjoy creating applications that I can use to improve my life. Planifie, a monthly planner web application, was one of them and I used it to organize the tasks I had to complete and plan ahead so I can work more productively.

## Jarvis Projects

Project source code: [https://github.com/jarviscanada/jarvis_data_eng_HeesooLim](https://github.com/jarviscanada/jarvis_data_eng_HeesooLim)


**Cluster Monitor** [[GitHub](https://github.com/jarviscanada/jarvis_data_eng_HeesooLim/tree/master/linux_sql)]: Created a Cluster Monitor program that monitors and stores the host machine's hardware information and resource usage. In this project, CentOS 7 was used for development/testing, and Docker was used to run the PostgreSQL instance that stores the host machine's information. The source code management was done with GitFlow, which is a branching model, and GIT. Each host has two bash scripts, and to start the monitoring program, a docker container should be running and the table should be created. Testing was done by executing each script and checking if the result meets requirements to ensure that every script runs without issues.

**Core Java Apps** [[GitHub](https://github.com/jarviscanada/jarvis_data_eng_HeesooLim/tree/master/core_java)]: 

  - Twitter App: Developed an application that uses REST API to interact with Twitter through the terminal by using the Tweeter REST API. This application enables users to search. post, and remove tweets. Maven was used to handle the lifecycle of the project including compilation, testing, validation, and packaging. To handle the request and response, `HttpClient` and JSON libraries were used. Automated testing for each class, such as `TwitterHttpHelper` and `TwitterDao`, was done using `JUnit` and `Mockito`
  - JDBC App: Built software that is capable of executing CRUD(Create, Read, Update, and Delete) operations against the PostgreSQL table using the JDBC driver. Different tables in PostgreSQL, such as `customer`, `orders`, `order_items`, `product`, and `salesperson` were created during the development. To ensure the application works as expected, manual testing was done by running the operations and checking the result.
  - Grep App: Created an application that searches for a string in groups of files like the `grep` command in Linux. To simplify the process of project building and increases the overall performance of the project and the building process, Maven was used. Docker was used to pack, deploy, and run the application as a lightweight container. As we also have to deal with the big size files, Lambda expressions were used to efficiently iterate through, filter, and extract data from a Collection of data.

## Highlighted Projects
**Planify** [[GitHub](https://github.com/HeesooLim/Planify)]: Implemented a monthly planner web application that allows users to create, view, edit, and delete their tasks. In this project, Pop!_OS was used for development. Utilized Angular (TypeScript) and Material Design Bootstrap (UI Kit) for the development of front-end, MongoDB to store the data, and ExpressJS and NodeJS to process the clients' requests. GIT was used as a source code management tool for the project.

**Tournado** [[GitHub](https://github.com/Runnergy/Tornado)]: Developed and deployed a web application to create and manage tournaments, update the tournament status, and view ongoing tournaments created by other users. Designed the UI of the application by employing Figma and utilized Expressjs to implement the front-end and completed the back-end by using Nodejs and MongoDB. Leveraged javascript animation library to add animation effects to the website.
