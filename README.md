# Heesoo Lim . Jarvis Consulting

I graduated from Centennial College with a diploma in Software Engineering Technology, and I have recently started my career as a backend developer at Jarvis. During my time at Centennial College, I served as a Full-Stack Developer at Alpha Labs, where I developed the back-end of a web application by utilizing ASP.NET and SQL server to store user data and built the front-end by using ASP.NET. As a result, I was able to gain foundational skills in back-end and front-end development, in addition to learning the importance of time management, collaboration, and precise communication. I also acquired and refined complementary skills in software engineering throughout my academic and personal projects. I started getting interested in programming when I was in high school as I enjoyed playing games and I wanted to develop a cool game that everyone would love. As I get to know more about different fields in computer science, I have gotten inspired by how technology is changing the whole world, especially learning and understanding how software processes our requests in its server were so fascinating for me.

## Jarvis Projects

Project source code: [https://github.com/jarviscanada/jarvis_data_eng_HeesooLim](https://github.com/jarviscanada/jarvis_data_eng_HeesooLim)


**Cluster Monitor** [[GitHub](https://github.com/jarviscanada/jarvis_data_eng_HeesooLim/tree/master/linux_sql)]: Created a Cluster Monitor program that monitors and stores the host machine's hardware information and resource usage. In this project, CentOS 7 was used for development/testing, and Docker was used to run the PostgreSQL instance that stores the host machine's information. The source code management was done with GitFlow, which is a branching model, and GIT. Each host has two bash scripts, and to start the monitoring program, a docker container should be running and the table should be created. Testing was done by executing each script and checking if the result meets requirements to ensure that every script runs without issues.

## Highlighted Projects
**Planify** [[GitHub](https://github.com/HeesooLim/Planify)]: Implemented a monthly planner web application that allows users to create, view, edit, and delete their tasks. In this project, Pop!_OS was used for development. Utilized Angular (TypeScript) and Material Design Bootstrap (UI Kit) for the development of front-end, MongoDB to store the data, and ExpressJS and NodeJS to process the clients' requests. GIT was used as a source code management tool for the project.

**Tournado** [[GitHub](https://github.com/Runnergy/Tornado)]: Developed and deployed a web application to create and manage tournaments, update the tournament status, and view ongoing tournaments created by other users. Designed the UI of the application by employing Figma and utilized Expressjs to implement the front-end and completed the back-end by using Nodejs and MongoDB. Leveraged javascript animation library to add animation effects to the website.
